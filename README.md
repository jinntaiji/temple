<h3 align="center">🏯 A skeleton static website generator 🏯</h3>

The bare essentials for any static website. An extremely simple, basic, bare bones static website generator which was made for usage in my blog. Includes basic templating engine, basic non-fully-featured markdown parser and html generator.

No comments. (LOL 😜)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Empty out the *app/posts* and shove in your own posts
3. Chuck in your templates into *app/templates*
4. Static files are generated into *app/static*

## Templating

- Variables go between pipes
- Repeatable pages (such as posts) should be stored into groups and provided with templates.
- Check examples
